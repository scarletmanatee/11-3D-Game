# 11-3D-Game
In this game I created a level that you can explore as a 3d character in third person camea. There are coins, but I could not get them to be picked up, and there was supposed to be a UI element that counts the number of coins at the top of the sceen, but I could not figure out how to do UI in a 3D game. I feel like it should be easy, but I had trouble finding information about this.
